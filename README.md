# bullseye-map-generator

A bullseye map generator primarily designed for the DCS Mirage 2000C, based on a French Air Force kneeboard example.

## Disclaimer

This tool will produce a readable map when setup properly, but it is not foolproof. It is easy to break intentionally.

The app is **not responsive** and **doesn't work on smartphone display**.

## Features

### Map generation

All elements are placed based on their azimuth and distance relative to the bullseye. The map is automatically scaled and the bullseye repositioned to ensure all the elements fit within the canvas.

#### Bullseye
The bullseye "spider" options like rings range and line angles can be customized. It can also be constrained to an area to improve readability.
